    <h2>The Glory Years</h2>

      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, 
        and Gareth Bale formed one of the most formidable attacking trios in Real Madrid's history, 
        often referred to as the "BBC" (Bale, Benzema, Cristiano). Together, 
        they were pivotal in the club’s dominance of European football during the 2010s. 
        Cristiano Ronaldo, with his incredible goal-scoring ability and leadership, was the standout star, 
        breaking numerous records and leading the team to four Champions League titles in five years. Benzema, 
        the French forward, was the perfect complement, offering technical brilliance, link-up play, and crucial goals in important moments, 
        often playing a selfless role to allow Ronaldo to shine. Bale, known for his blistering pace and powerful shots, 
        brought a dynamic presence to the wing, scoring unforgettable goals, including his stunning solo effort in the 2014 Copa del Rey final. 
        Together, the BBC trio helped Real Madrid secure major honors, including four Champions League trophies, 
        while becoming one of the most iconic attacking partnerships in the history of the club and modern football.</p>

    <h2>Challenges and Setbacks</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <img src="Galácticos.jpg" alt="Real Madrid Setbacks" width="600" height="400">
      <p>Despite its immense success, Real Madrid has faced numerous challenges and setbacks throughout its storied history. 
        One of the club's most notable struggles came in the late 1960s and early 1970s when, after a golden era, 
        the team experienced a period of decline. Their dominance in European football waned, 
        and they were overshadowed by rivals like Barcelona and Atlético Madrid domestically. In the 2000s, 
        despite the "Galácticos" era, where star players like Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, and Ronaldo were signed, 
        the team often fell short in key competitions, particularly the Champions League. Another challenge came in the form of inconsistent managerial changes, 
        as Real Madrid frequently parted ways with coaches, leading to a lack of long-term stability. More recently, 
        the club faced challenges in the post-Cristiano Ronaldo era, struggling to fill the void left by the Portuguese legend’s departure. 
        Despite these setbacks, Real Madrid’s resilience and ability to bounce back are hallmarks of their history, 
        consistently returning to the top with renewed strength and determination.</p>

    <h2>The Comeback</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <img src="Comeback.jpg" alt="Real Madrid Comeback" width="600" height="400">
      <p>Real Madrid has become synonymous with unforgettable comebacks, particularly in high-stakes encounters against top-tier teams like Borussia Dortmund, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), 
        and Chelsea. One of the most famous came in the 2013-14 UEFA Champions League group stage, where they overturned a 2-0 deficit against Dortmund with a late 2-2 draw, 
        though the result still haunted them as Dortmund eliminated them in the semifinals that same season. Against Manchester City in the 2021-22 Champions League semifinals, 
        Madrid's resilience was on full display as they staged an extraordinary comeback in the second leg at the Bernabéu, turning a 5-3 aggregate deficit into a dramatic 6-5 win, 
        capped by goals from Rodrygo and a memorable extra-time strike from Karim Benzema. Similarly, 
        in 2018-19, they came from behind to beat PSG in the Round of 16 after losing 3-1 in Paris, advancing with a determined 2-1 victory at home. In 2023, 
        their historic comeback against Chelsea in the quarterfinals of the Champions League showed their trademark resolve, 
        fighting back from a difficult first leg to eliminate the Blues and continue their quest for another European title. 
        These dramatic moments are a testament to Real Madrid's spirit and ability to rise to the occasion, particularly in the most challenging of circumstances.</p>
